# HEVD Solutions

I gave a try to HEVD and find it pretty interesting to learn Windows Kernel Exploit Development. So I decided to share my own solutions for the vulnerable driver. Enjoy.

## Getting Started

I used Visual Studio 2017 to compile these solutions as I wrote solutions in C++.

## Environment

* [Visual Studio 2017 Professional](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [Windows 7 x86](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/) - Free Virtual Machines from MS

## Contributing

You can contribute to the project by submitting alternate solutions. I will highly appreciate that.
